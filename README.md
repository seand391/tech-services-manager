# Tech Services Manager

_By Sean Driscoll_

### Project Goals

The end goal of this project is to create a responsive, user-friendly, and customizable web app that serves as a
managment dashboard for customer-facing tech service workers. Some of the main focuses of the user interface
will be flaws I found with software I have used in the past, such as an excessively long and complicated intake
process and extremely lackluster organization options. Noboby wants to sit there waiting awkwardly while the
tech worker clicks through fifty unskippable check boxes that don't matter, and everybody loves a well organized
dashboard. Especially when multiple different people are using it and need to quickly assess what is going on.

## Tech

I plan to use the following technologies throughout this project, but will update the final documentation
accordingly if anything changes:

- **_React_**
- **_Next.js_**
- **_Node.js_**
- **_AWS: Amplify, S3, GraphQL API, (maybe more)_**
- **_Tailwind CSS_**
- **_JavaScript/TypeScript_**
- **_HTML_**
- **_Figma_**
- **_ESLint_**
- **_Visual Studio Code_**
- **_GitHub_**
